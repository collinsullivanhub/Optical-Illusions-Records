        <p>Hey all,</p>
        <p>This is Collin (Terrestrial Access Network) and Carson (Lakehop).</p>
        <p>We are looking to seriously kickstart our pet project, a US-based electro imprint called Optical Illusions, which we started a couple years ago. This is going to be both a vinyl and digital label where we aim for 2 Vinyl releases per year and a Few digital VAs.</p>
        <p>Here’s our short term plan for the next six months:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Vinyl 6-Track release (3A/3B) - Need demos</li>
            <li>Digital Compilation x2 - Need demos</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: We are looking for mainly breaks and electro</p>
        <p>If you are interested in submitting demos could you please flag in your demo email which (or both) release you would like to be a part of( vinyl/digital), that would be very helpful. We’re looking at dedicating resources to rebranding the artwork and promotion. The label will be distributed through Triple Vision</p>
        <p>We are requesting demo links by June 30. Please send a link/links to <a href="mailto:opticalillusions@protonmail.com">opticalillusions@protonmail.com</a></p>
